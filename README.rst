=========================================
Image classifier - Udacity DSND project 2
=========================================


-----------------------
Purpose of this project
-----------------------

As part of the UDACITY Data Scientist Nanodegree, I worked on a **machine learning** project. The purpose of this project was two-fold:
- build a classifier of flowers images using this dataset : http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html
- build a python script to train a model and predict the name of a flower when provided an image

We were guided through the method, and the Jupyter notebook of this repository traces back each step and result.

In this repository, you will find:

- A Jupyter notebook exposing the approach to build the classifier
- An html version of the notebook
- a train.py python script that trains a model using a database of classified images
- a predict.py python script that predicts the name of flower when provided an image
- model_classfile.py and utility.py class files used by the two scripts
- a json file (cat_to_name) matching category to name
- a LICENCE file
- This readme file


-----------------------
Installation requisites
-----------------------

| To document the code, I used Jupyter notebook 6.0.0.
| The code is written in Python 3 (v3.6).

The following libraries were used extensively in the code:

- numpy 1.16.4
- pandas 0.25.0
- torch 1.1
- seaborn 0.9.0


--------------------
How to use this code
--------------------

The Jupyter notebook is divided into several subsections, and markdown cells exposes the approach and the conclusions. Code cells in between are followed by their output printed.
Feel free to reuse any piece of code, or walk through the notebook to get an insight on the method and decisions taken!
